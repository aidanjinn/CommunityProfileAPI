**Acadia Parish, Louisiana: Community Profile**

Acadia Parish, located in southwestern Louisiana, is a vibrant community deeply rooted in its Cajun heritage.  Founded in 1886 from portions of St. Landry Parish, its name reflects the historical connection to the Acadians, French settlers expelled from Canada.  This legacy is powerfully felt through the parishâ€™s rich cultural traditions, expressed in annual festivals like the International Rice Festival in Crowley, the Frog Festival in Rayne, and the Buggy Festival in Church Point.  These celebrations showcase Cajun cuisine, music, and the unique custom of Courir de Mardi Gras, a festive begging tradition culminating in a communal gumbo supper and dance.  Beyond its cultural significance, Acadia Parish is known for its agricultural production, particularly rice cultivation, which plays a significant role in its economy.  The parish's relatively small size and largely rural character contribute to a close-knit community feel, despite its proximity to the larger Lafayette metropolitan area. The area features a mix of urban centers like Crowley and smaller towns and villages, creating a diverse landscape of life.
