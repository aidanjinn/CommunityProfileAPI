**Airmont, New York: Community Profile**

Airmont is a village in Rockland County, New York, incorporated in 1991 from the hamlets of Tallman, Airmont, and South Monsey.  Its creation, intended to preserve a suburban aesthetic, has been marked by significant legal challenges concerning zoning laws and accusations of religious discrimination against the Orthodox Jewish community.  These disputes, involving both state and federal courts, centered on restrictions impacting the building of synagogues and yeshivas, leading to revised zoning codes and settlements with the Department of Justice.  Despite these legal battles, Airmont has experienced substantial population growth,  reflecting a dynamic community grappling with issues of development, religious diversity, and its evolving identity within Rockland County.  The village's history is characterized by tensions between maintaining its planned suburban character and accommodating the needs of its diverse population.  Recent events, including a high-profile arrest of a former deputy mayor, further underscore the complex social and political landscape of this relatively young municipality.
